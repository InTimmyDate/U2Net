# Setup
Firstly setup U2Net according to original paper readme

# Changes done for the project
The `u2net_test.py` file was changed for the project. The original output of the program was a silhoutte of the detected object,
we added some post processing to apply the silhoutte on the original image in order to filter out the background and useless features in the save_output function.

#To Run the Code
Simply config the parameters `model_name`, `image_dir`, `prediction_dir`, and `model_dir` according to your setup.
Then move to the project dir and run
```
python u2net_test.py
```
The processed images will be saved to your `prediction_dir`
